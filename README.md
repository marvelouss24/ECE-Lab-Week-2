The main.c file relies on a header file and a source file that act as drivers for the main.c file. 
The main.c file uses functions from the drivers to declare whatever pins you want as the input or output. 
Later in the main.c file has the purpose of actually implementing the button press and requires some modificaiton depending on the pins chosen for the input and output.
